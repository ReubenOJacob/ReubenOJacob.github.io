                                    <p>Easy to use safety device with location tracking and SOS broadcasting features. With a small footprint and a single button interface this device is meant for women and children. It can also be hung around pet collars and used for Alzheimerâ€™s patients. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>When triggered, the device uses a GPS module to trace the location of the area. This data is processed by a microcontroller which then uses a GSM module to send a SMS alert to a set of preset guardian numbers. The location data once triggered is continuously backed up on an online database which can be accessed by the guardians through a login ID and password. The device has two operational modes, continuous broadcasting and an SOS mode. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>A particular function of this device is the implementation of community security. When a device is triggered the database compares the location of the user to the home and last known location of other such users and sends them SMS alerts of a community member in danger.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The device is equipped with a vibrational motor and a buzzer to alert the user of an incoming text message. A piezo electric sensor is also attached to the shell of the device in order to alert the guardian if the device has been broken. </p>
