									<li align="justify" >This project was done in a collaboration with a university funded project team known as Edhitha. Edhitha specializes in making advanced UAVâ€™s. This drone was implemented in order to compete in the 2018 AUVSI SUAS, an international forum where colleges from all around the world develop and demonstrate advanced unmanned aerial systems capable of various autonomous tasks. </li>
                                   <li align="justify" >The project consists of a specialized autonomous aerial system capable of automatic take off, landing, navigation and air drop capabilities. It uses a Pixhawk flight controller which is a popular general-purpose flight controller based on the Pixhawk-project FMUv2 open hardware design. All other flight systems are built with readily available components as well. </li>
                                    <li align="justify" >The UAV is also capable of continuously transmitting images taken via a DSLR camera and transmit them to a ground control station with location details making it capable of surveillance and reconnaissance missions. </li>
                                    <li align="justify" >This project was awarded 10th place in the 2018 SUAS competition and was also featured in a local newspaper article for the same (The Indian Express). </li>
